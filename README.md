## Overview of the Problem

With the COVID vaccines available to public, more and more data analysts are spending time studying social media responses to various producers with vaccination progress. We leveraged the most recent Tweet data from Kaggle to assess user sentiment, identify most popular topics of tweets using topic modelling and sentiment analysis. We also studied the relationship between user sentiment and vaccine producers (extracted from hashtages of tweets) to identify differences in social media reactions toward various vaccine producers. Finally, we explored the relationship between the user behavoir and the user sentiments about the vaccines over time to further decipher social media discussion toward COVID vaccines, which we hope would help gonvernors understand the current and ongoiing attitudes toward COVID vaccine related events and policies and guidelines.
