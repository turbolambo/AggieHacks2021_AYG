**Data collection frequency**
The collection was in the first days twice a day, until Gabriel Preda identified approximatively the new tweets quota and then collection (for all vaccines) stabilized at once a day, during morning hours (GMT).

The data used in this analysis is updated until 4/8/2021.

Thanks to Kaggler Gabriel Preda for providing such a good dataset!
